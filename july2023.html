        <h2>Deconstruction?</h2>
          <p><b>"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us." (1 John 2:19 ESV)."</b></p>
          <p>This month I added an update to the <a href="Ebal.html"> Mt. Ebal</a> discussion. Here I made mention of a Dr. Davis, a deconstructed ex-Christian bible scholar, who had made a largely <i>ad hominem</i> (personal) attack on another bible scholar who just happened to be a believing Christian. Then I added a link to the withering reply.  While looking at Youtube videos, I discovered other people who were "deconstructed" attacking Christ and the Church.  So what is going on?</p>
          <p>Basically, there are two things going on.  First, the church is not doing an effective job of teaching their young people the Bible and how to use it in evangelism.  Second, it is part of the end times prophecy that in the last days some, who formerly professed Christ, will give up their faith. <i>"Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared."</i> (1 Timothy 4:1-2 ESV).</p>
          <p>On YouTube, those announcing their deconstruction will tell us how they grew up in an "evangelical" or "fundamentalist" church, and when bringing their questions to others in their church became unconvinced by the answers they would get. One such young lady, which I will not name, provided several scripture verses that offended her 21st century feminist sensibilities and convinced her that the God of the Bible was a kind of monster!</p>
          <p>First, she goes to Romans 9:14-23 and tells us that God has determined before the world began that most will go to hell and some would be saved. She fails to notice the context. God is talking about Gentiles as a GROUP being grafted into the tree of God's people.  How does God determine that this would happen?  It is by faith (Romans 9:30-32) that Gentiles are grafted in to replace those cut out due to their unbelief. Second, from Psalm 137:9 people want to dash babies against rocks. Yes, that is a terrible thing to say, but what does this expression of anguish and a desire for revenge have to do with God?  Then, she attacks the law of God in Deuteronomy 20 and 22.  God condemned a people to destruction who after much warning, and after living lives of debauchery (much like today!) experienced God's judgement.  She was upset that God actually judged sin.  She refused to recognize the patience of God in waiting so long before judgement.  Finally, she condemned John 3:16 by saying that God is a monster who does not love the world, and Jesus is not God the Son of the Father as his deity was a  later invention.  If you read my notes on God under Defense, you will find that is not true (see also John 1:1, 8:53, Colossians 1 and Philippians 2.)</p>
          <p>We need to move beyond our immature notions of what God is like, and repent of our sins.  God cannot just "love" everyone and forgive sins without repentence.  If God does not judge sin then He is impotent.  God does not need to answer to us but we need to answer to Him (Job 38).</p>
          <p>Pray:  <i>"Dear Lord, as I look around at the ugliness and unbelief in our society, help me to look up and rejoice that you are coming soon.  Never allow me to stop praying for souls to  come to know Jesus before it is too late."</i></p>
