        <h2>My Utmost for His Highest</h2>
        <p>“My Utmost for His Highest. . . my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be ashamed. . . We sill all feel very much ashamed if we do not yield to Jesus the areas of our lives, He has asked us to yield to Him.  It’s as if Paul (Philippians 1:20) were saying, ‘My determined purpose is to be my utmost for His highest—my best for His glory.”  To reach that level of determination is a matter of the will, not of debate or of reasoning.  It is absolute and irrevocable surrender of the will at this point.  An undue amount of thought and consideration for ourselves is what keeps us from making that decision, although we cover it up with the pretense that it is others we are considering.  When we think seriously about what it will cost others if we obey the call of Jesus, we will tell God He doesn’t know what our obedience will mean.  Keep to the point—He does know.  Shut out every other thought and keep yourself before God in this one thing only—my utmost for His highest.  I am determined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and Him alone.”</p>
        <p>No one, including me, is asking anyone to come to God in perfect form.  You need to “repent” which means “to change direction by changing your mind.”  You must make a DECISION to follow Christ, not clean up your life to follow Him.  You CAN’T clean up your life!  Don’t you understand that you appear before God as a despicable, disgusting piece of human trash worthy of death!! That is why Jesus had to die.  God sent Jesus to take your place in death so that you can have a new life.  Once you DECIDE to follow Christ, He will clean up your life over your lifetime.  The immediate effects of repentance are to repay those whom you have hurt (Luke 19:1-10).  Therefore, when you decide to follow Christ, you must go to all of God’s people whom you have slandered or hurt in anyway,and ask for forgiveness.  Agree to be a help in the body of Christ not a hindrance. Until and unless you do these things, you can go on to a better life.</p>
        <p>Pray: “God, help to follow you completely and fully.  I am only worthy of death unless you get a hold of me. I choose a lifetime of obedience.”</p>
