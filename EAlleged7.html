          <p><b>Does every man sin?</b></p> 
          <p>KI1 8:46 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near; </p>
          <p>CH2 6:36 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;</p>
          <p>PRO 20:9 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? </p>
          <p>ECC 7:20 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</p>
          <p>JO1 1:8-10 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</p>
          <p>JO1 3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</p>
          <p><i>This is not a contradiction.  It is clear from reading Romans 1-3 that there are two kinds of righteousness:  one from following the Law of God, and the other from trusting in Jesus to deliver us from our sin.  Following the Law requires an absolutely sinless life, which Paul makes clear is impossible—hence the need for the righteousness that Jesus provides.  When the believer trusts Christ as Savior, he/she has Christ’s righteousness and is a new creation—born again.  This new nature does not sin.  As the believer affords the righteousness of Christ he cannot sin.  Indeed, the believer may sin when he or she turns away from Christ and back to the old nature.  This turning away is always temporary if the believer truly knows Christ.  The Greek word in the 1 John 3:9 passage translated erroneously as “commit” is <span lang="el">ποιεῖ</span><sup>19</sup> which means “practice.”  The true believer does not “practice” sin.</i></p>
          <p><b>Who bought potter's field?</b></p>
          <p>ACT 1:18-19 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.</p>
          <p>MAT 27:6-8 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</p>
          <p><i>This was already answered in “Who bought the field?”</i></p>
          <p><b>Who prophesied the potter's field?</b></p>
          <p>Matthew 27:9-10 (mentions Jeremy but no such verse in Jeremiah) is in Zechariah 11:12-13</p>
          <p><i>Though this was indeed discussed in Zechariah, it is also discussed in general terms in Jeremiah (cf. 19:1-13; 32:6-9).  Indeed, it was apparently common for the New Testament writers to cite the more important (major vs. minor) prophet when quoting a conflation of two passages (cf. Mark 1:2--> Malachi 3:1, Isaiah 40:3).<sup>20</sup> It is amazing to me that the fact that this was miraculously foretold about Jesus centuries before the event, seems to have escaped this atheist!!</i></p>

        <p><b>Who bears guilt?</b></p>
        <p>GAL 6:2 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. </p>
        <p>GAL 6:5 For every man shall bear his own burden. </p>
        <p><i>A look at the Greek text easily solves this problem.  The words for burden are different in v. 2 and v. 5.  In v. 2, the word for “burden” is <span lang="el"> βάρη</span><sup>21</sup>   which means “troubles, heaviness [of responsibilities].”  In v. 6, it is <span lang="el"> φορτίον</span><sup>22</sup>   “load” or “cargo.”  In v. 2, Christians are required to help one another out.  In v. 5, Christians are required not to be boastful or try to look better through making comparisons.  Instead, these people need to take care of their own affairs without drawing attention to themselves.</i></p>
        <p><b>Do you answer a fool?</b></p>
        <p>PRO 26:4-5 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.</p>
        <p><i>The point here is that we must discern the situation:  at times we must ignore the stupid actions of others, at other times we may need to repeat the folly back to an individual to show them how stupid their actions are.  It depends on the messenger and the one receiving the message, which strategy is appropriate at any given time.</i></p>
        <p><b>How many children did Michal, the daughter of Saul, have?</b></p>
        <p>SA2 6:23 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death. </p>
        <p>SA2 21:8 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite: </p>
        <p><i>The 2 Samuel 21:8 passage states Saul’s daughter Merab in some Hebrew manuscripts and some versions of LXX.  This is probably a manuscript (transmission) error in which a scribe was trying to reconcile the 2 Samuel 21:8 passage with the knowledge that Saul’s daughter Michal had married David (unwittingly forcing an apparent contradiction with 2 Samuel 6:23!).  But why couldn’t two of Saul’s daughters be married to David, just as two of Laban’s daughters were married to Jacob?</i></p>
        <p><b>How old was Jehoiachin when he began to reign?</b></p>
        <p>KI2 24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. </p>
        <p>CH2 36:9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.</p>
        <p><i>While it is true that in most Hebrew manuscripts, the 2 Kings 24:8 passage has the number eighteen <span lang="he"> עֲשֶׂ֣רֶת </span><sup>23</sup> and eight <span lang="he">שְׁמוֹנֶ֤ה</span><sup>24</sup> in 2 Chronicles 36:9.  One Hebrew manuscript, some LXX versions and a Syriac version supports eighteen in both passages (cf. NAB, NIV).  Sure, it is possible that a scribe tried to correct an inconsistency, but it is just as possible that he did not.  For more discussion on this and other alleged numerical discrepancies, see Geisler and Brooks, p. 173.</i></p>
        <p><b>Marriage?</b></p>
        <p>Proverbs 18:22; 1 Corinthians 7 (whole book. See 1,2,27,39,40)</p>
        <p><i>Has this atheist even bothered to read 1 Corinthians 7?  Verses 2 and 27a alone encourage marriage.  Paul is not contradicting what Proverbs 18:22 or Song of Songs says for that matter!  Paul is simply being practical here.  If one is married, one has to think about others beside him/herself and this precludes or forces modifications on ministry.  For example, when my wife got sick in China I decided I needed to help get her treatment (a better diet) and this caused us to return to the United States earlier than I would have if I were there alone.</i></p><p></p>
