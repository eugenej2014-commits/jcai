       <h2>A Loving Date with Eternity</h2>
       <p><i>This is the month for Thanksgiving and an opportunity to think on the things we are most thankful for. I heard the following story several years ago from Father John Powell, a professor at Loyola University in Chicago. It is about love.  It is about God.  It is about the intense pursuit that God makes for us and the lengths He will go to get our attention.  It is longer than what I usually post but please read to the end.  You will be blessed. Remember, never write anybody off.</i></p>
          <p>Some twelve years ago, I stood watching my university students file  into the classroom for our first session in the Theology of Faith.</p>
          <p>That was the day I first saw Tommy. My eyes and my mind both blinked. He was combing his long flaxen hair, which hung six inches below his shoulders. It was the first time I had ever seen a boy with hair that long. I guess it was just coming into fashion then. I know in my mind that it isn't what's on your head but  what's in it that counts; but on that day I was unprepared and my  emotions flipped. I immediately filed Tommy under "S" for strange.  Very strange.</p>
          <p>Tommy turned out to be the "atheist in residence" in my Theology of Faith course. He constantly objected to, smirked at, or whined about the possibility of an unconditionally loving Father/God.   We lived with each other in relative peace for one semester, although I admit he was for me at times a serious pain in the back pew.  When he came up at the end of the course to turn in  his final exam, he asked in a cynical tone, "Do you think I'll ever  find God?"</p>
          <p>I decided instantly on a little shock therapy. "No!" I said very emphatically.</p>
          <p>"Why not," he responded, "I thought that was the product you were pushing."</p>
          <p>I let him get five steps from the classroom door and then called out, "Tommy! I don't think you'll ever find Him, but I am absolutely certain that He will find you!" He shrugged a little and
          left my class and my life.  I felt slightly disappointed at the thought that he had missed my clever line --- He will find you! At least I thought it was clever.</p>
          <p>Later I heard that Tommy had graduated and I was duly grateful.</p>
          <p>Then a sad report came. I heard that Tommy had terminal cancer. Before I could search him out, he  came to see me. When he walked into my office, his body was very badly wasted and the long hair had all fallen out as a result of chemotherapy. But his eyes were bright and his voice was firm, for the first time, I believe. "Tommy, I've thought about you so often. I hear you are sick," I blurted out.</p>
          <p>"Oh, yes, very sick. I have cancer in both lungs. It's a matter of weeks."</p>
          <p>"Can you talk about it, Tom?" I asked.</p>
          <p>"Sure, what would you like to know?" he replied.</p>
          <p>"What's it like to be only twenty-four and dying?"</p>
          <p>"Well, it could be worse."</p>
          <p>"Like what?"</p>
          <p>"Well, like being fifty and having no values or ideals, like being fifty and thinking that booze,
          seducing women, and making money are the real biggies' in life."</p>
