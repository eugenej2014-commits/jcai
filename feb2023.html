        <h2>Teaching or Training?</h2>
        <p><i>"But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect.</i> (1Pe 3:15 NIV)</p>
          <p>I was recently perusing an article which asked this question: "Are we training our people or are we just teaching?" The gist of the article was that in our churches we are spending our time on teaching the word, which is great, but we are not spending time on training. What is meant here is that in our churches we are not training our people as warriers to go out into the world and confront our culture.  Our people are not being equipped to answer people's questions about God and life.  "Is there a God?" and speaking of our universe, "Why is there something rather than nothing?"</p>
          <p>I've recently been reading several physics and philosophy books and I have to say that I have become more confident in the truth and power of the Word of God as I come to understand what is going on in modern science. Modern science has confirmed that the universe had a beginning as Genesis says.  Many theoretical physicists and philosophers are freaking out that science is confirming what we know from Genesis and they just don't know what to do with themselves.  They are frantically coming up with ideas such as Many Worlds hypothesis (the theory that our universe is just one of many universes) and even suggesting that the universe just popped into existence (even though real science disproved spontaneous generation in the 19th century).</p> 
          <p>Darwinism isn't working out so well either. Transitions between different animals have not been found in the fossil record. Mathemeticians say that even a 4.5 billion-year-old earth isn't enough time for random mutations to evolve single-celled organisims into trillion-celled humans. Some not willing to accept Creation have even suggested that aliens seeded the earth billions of years ago!</p>
          <p>The problem I have with atheistic philosophers masquerading as scientists is that they have moved from science which is observable and testable into philosophy where ideas are vulnerable to refutaion by logic and reason.  Always be ready to give a reason for the hope that is within you.</p>
          <p>Pray: "Heavenly Father, help us to be diligent to study the culture just as we study the Word so we will be more effective in our world."</p>
