        <h5>Interview with God </h5>
        <p></p>
        <p><i>“This is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.”</i> (Psalm 118:24  ESV)</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I dreamed I had an Interview with God.</p>
        <p>“So, you would like to Interview me?" God asked.</p>
        <p>God smiled and said, “My time is eternity.  What questions do you have in mind for me? “</p>
        <p>I replied, “If it were possible for you to be surprised, what would surprise you most about humanity?” </p>
        <p>God answered …. </p>
        <p>“That they get bored with childhood.  They rush to grow up and then long to be children again. That they lose their health to make money, and then lose their money to restore their health.  By thinking so anxiously about the future that they forget the present, such that they live in neither the present nor the future. That they live as if they will never die and die as if they had never lived.” </p>
        <p>God's hand took mine and we were silent for a while. </p>
        <p>And then I asked … </p>
        <p>“As the creator of people what are some of life's lessons you want them to learn?” </p>
        <p>God replied with a smile. </p>
        <p>“To learn they cannot make anyone love them. What they can do is let themselves be loved and learn that it is not good to compare themselves to others. To learn that a rich person is not one who has the most, but is one who needs the least. To learn that it takes only a few seconds to open profound wounds in persons we love, and it takes many years to heal them. To learn to forgive by practicing forgiveness. To learn that there are persons who love them dearly, but simply do not know how to express or show their feelings. To learn that two people can look at the same thing and see it differently. To learn that it is not always enough that they are forgiven by others. They must forgive themselves. And to learn that I am here. Always."</p>
        <p>The only comments I have is (1) This is not original with me.  If anyone knows the original author, please let me know, and (2) that I am not quite sure of the theological accuracy of the events of this dream, but I am certain of the practical accuracy of its wisdom.</p>
        <p><b>Pray:  “That God would help us to number our days, not waste time and obey Him.”</b></p>
