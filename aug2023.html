        <h2>Changing the Subject?</h2>
          <p><i>"Then the master told his servant, 'Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.  I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet." </i>Luke 14:23-24 NIV</p>
          <p>For this month I was inspired by Joni Eareckson Tada's devotion for August 1. She recounted the story of Jesus, who had been invited to the home of a Pharisee and had challenged them about healing on the Sabbath. He then went on to heal a man in their presence. Jesus then went on to comment on how many of them take the most prominent places at the wedding feasts they attend. He told the wealthy men that theyshould take the least preeminent places. In the uncomfortable silence that followed, another man present spoke up and said, "Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God (Luke 14:15)" apparently to move on from the awkward conversation.  He felt the need to change the subject.</p>
          <p>When we are in prayer or worse, at a bible study or sermon, and God points out our little hypocrisies such as addictions, or failure to resolve conflicts we might have with others in the body of Christ, do we want to change the subject? As they say in Fargo, "You betcha."  Most certainly, because we don't like to be found out. But if we confess our sins regularly we experience the other thing Jesus did in a group-- get our feet washed (John 13).  Jesus knows that we are failures. Even Peter who did not like Jesus washing feet like a slave, tried to change the subject.  "Not just my feet.  Wash my body." To which Jesus replied, "Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you." (Joh 13:10 NIV)" We only need to wash our feet. Jesus makes us clean by his blood, but through prayer and confession of sin, he keeps us clean in our walk.</p>
          <p>Pray:  <i>"Dear Lord, help me to always walk with you in honesty about ourselves and others."</i></p>
