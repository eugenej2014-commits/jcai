          <p>In the past, atheists and agnostics alike delighted in a pasttime of picking the Bible apart to try and convince the believer how foolish it was to base their faith on an obviously human book riddled with errors and contradictions.  However, more sophisticated believers would simply point out that the vast majority of alleged inaccuracies were based on faulty translations of the original text; in the beginning God spoke and then in translation the problems began. Skeptics, correctly, would counter that faith based in the original manuscripts is still problematic for the believer since we have no original manuscript.  Therefore, the faith in the Bible's accuracy could never be falsified because there was no manuscript that could be held up to scrutiny.  The belever would have faith in a document that no one can demonstrate to exist; therefore, a faith in nothing.</p>
          <p>This work attempts to tackle this problem by systematically addressing each alleged Bible difficulty as it comes up by appealing to historical research (biblical textual criticism) to show the evidence that these problems probably did not exist in an original document.  We can use the same inductive tools of secular literature to reconstruct the missing original document and feel very satisfied that our faith is built on something solid.  Seriously, if you want to do damage to the integrity of Scripture, you must, to be consistent, do the same to all reconstruction of historical events.  Most skeptics are unwilling to do that.</p>

          <p>I have attempted to show in translations both in English and Chinese (中文), that the Bible can be trusted to be an accurate representation of what God spoke.</p><p></p>
