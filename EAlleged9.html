          <p><b>Destruction of cities (what said was Jeremiah was Zechariah)</b></p>  
      <p>MAT 27:9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, and they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; </p>
      <p>Zechariah 11:11-13 (nothing in Jeremiah remotely like)</p>
      <p><i>The title doesn’t match the discussion in the texts, but if the author is referring to the apparent discrepancy concerning which prophet, Jeremiah or Zechariah, prophesied about Judas’ betrayal of Jesus, this was already answered in “Who prophesied the Potter’s field?”</i></p>
      <p><b>Whose sepulchers?</b></p>
      <p>Acts 7:16</p>
    <p>Genesis 23:17,18 </p>
      <p><i>The cave in the field of Machpelah was purchased by Abraham for he and his wife, while the tomb that was bought from the sons of Hamor was designated for his progeny.  The reference in Acts 7:16 is actually concerning the burial plot purchased by Jacob for his sons at Shechem (Joshua 24:32).  There are actually several other conflations and distortions that we could point out:  Acts 7:6 mentions 400 years of slavery, whereas Exodus 12:40 mentions 430, and vv. 2 and 3 seems to claim that the message that came to Abraham came before he lived in Haran, whereas Genesis 12:1 suggests it came to him while in Haran.  What can we say about this?  Richard N. Longenecker identifies these conflations and inexactitude of popular Judaism that had parallels with other popular writings of the day (cf. Philo De Abraham 62-67).  Luke was trying to capture the stress and enthusiasm of Stephen whose speech, though definitely passionate for God, was not inspired in the sense that the letter of Paul to the Romans was.<sup>27</sup></i></p>
      <p><b>Strong drink?</b></p>
      <p>Proverbs 31:6,7</p>
      <p>John 2:11-11 </p>
      <p><i>The Proverbs passage is a discussion of why kings should not be influenced with strong drink.  Strong drink affects judgment.  However, for those who are dying, drink can be a source of comfort, a sort of anesthetic.  I don’t see how the wedding of Cana in John 2:1-11 (where Jesus turned the water into wine, not strong drink) has anything to do with the Proverbs passage just discussed.</i></p>
      <p><b>When is the second coming?</b></p>
      <p>MAT 24:34 Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. </p>
      <p>MAR 13:30 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done. </p>
      <p>LUK 21:32 Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled. </p>

        <p>1 Thessalonians 4:15-18 </p>
      <p><i>“Generation” in the Matthew, Mark, and Luke passages can also mean “race.”<sup>28</sup>  The Matthew, Mark and Luke passages mentioned have their fulfillment in the time of the Lord’s return (1 Thessalonians 4:15-18).</i></p>

      <p>250 in II Chron 8:10</p>

      <p><b>The mother of Abijah</b></p>
      <p>Maachah the daughter of Absalom 2 Chron 9:20 </p>
      <p>Michaiah the daughter of Uriel 2 Chron 13:2</p>
      <p><i>I went to 2 Chronicles 9:20 and didn’t find the reference referred to.  Perhaps the author means 2 Chronicles 11:20 which states that Maacah, daughter of Absalom gave birth to Abijah..  Uriel was the father in the 2 Chronicles 13:2 passage.  Most LXX manuscripts and Syriac support “Maacah” in the 2 Chronicles 13:2. Indeed, though the Hebrew supports “Micaiah” the mistake is probably a copyist error.</i></p>

      <p><b>Psalm 137:9 – Is it a good thing to dash babies against rocks?</b></p>
      <p><i>This is only one of several scriptures that some might feel display a questionable morality approved of by God (cf. Deuteronomy 7:2 the “ban” <i>ḥâram</i> against the Canaanite people.  Other scriptures which use phrases like Psalm 137:9 are 2 Kings 8:12; Isaiah 13:16; Hosea 13:6 and Nehemiah 3:10).  A key word here is <i><sup>ᴐ</sup>âshar</i> translated into English as “blessed”.  A better translation here would be “straight” or “correct,” The Psalmist is not declaring the killing of babies as a joyful event, but as the inevitability of “eye for eye” justice.  With only justice and without mercy this is what Jesus’ expression “do to others as you would wish were done to you” (Matthew 7:12; Luke 6:31) might look like: “do to others what others have done to you”! As to the “ban” or “devotion to the Lord” in scriptures like Deuteronomy 7:2, this is not a vindictive wholesale slaughter on the part of God.  It is a reference to what happens when the holiness of God moves in on unprotected humanity (the protection would be a blood sacrifice; ultimately the shed blood of Christ).  Also, as the Israelites advanced, the people could have fled.  There was no command to pursue them beyond the promised land.

        <h6><sup>29</sup>Part of the reason for the command to destroy the Canaanites was that they were themselves under God’s judgment for their sin. The beginning of their story in the Bible goes back to their ancestor Ham, the son of Noah (Gn. 10:6, 15-18). Canaan, Ham’s son, was laid under a curse because of Ham’s lack of filial respect for his father (Gn. 9:20-25). When the land of Canaan was promised to Abraham’s descendants, it was not given straight away because ‘the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure’ (Gn. 15:16).
