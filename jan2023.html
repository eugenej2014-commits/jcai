        <h2>As a Living Sacrifice</h2>
          <p><i>"Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God--this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will."</i> (Rom 12:1-2 NIV)</p>
          <p>Offering our bodies for God’s service IS worship. God cares little for outward religious expression if it is not accompanied by a surrender of our very being to God (Amos 5:21-24). What is our motivation to do so? It is the view of God’s mercy toward us as demonstrated at the cross!</p>
          <p>This is the test: Does your mind direct you to do what the world tells you is the correct way to behave, or has your mind been renewed to do what God tells you is the correct way. Though you do not have the power to change your heart, you do have the power to change your mind, or why would God command you to do so! Remember Corrie ten Boom who suffered humiliation at the hands of nazi guards, watched as her dear sister slowly died from nazi brutality. After the war, Corrie was preaching in a church. One of her former guards, not recognizing her, came up to her to thank her for her message. He had apparently been converted. When he reached out his hand to shake her hand, Corrie was filled with hatred and couldn’t bring herself to shake his hand. She, as an act of her will which began in her mind, prayed and asked God to change her heart. Instantaneously He did. She felt God’s love envelope her and she was able to shake his hand.</p>
          <p>We are commanded to make a choice at some point of time concerning to whom we will serve for, we will serve someone or something. God will not be shared with idols. This is an either or proposition.</p>
          <p>Pray: "Heavenly Father, teach me what a living sacrifice is in my own life"</p>
