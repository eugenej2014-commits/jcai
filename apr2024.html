        <h2>Do You Have Room?</h2>
          <p><i>"But the herders of Gerar quarreled with those of Isaac and said, "The water is ours!" So he named the well Esek, because they disputed with him. Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah. He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth, saying, "Now the LORD has given us room and we will flourish in the land." </i>(Genesis 26:20-22 NIV)</p>
          <p>A remarkable story of perserverance in adversity, Isaac found soom room.  After finding water in the valley, Isaac thought he was on his way to success. But it was not to be. His herders got into a quarrel with the locals over watering rights.  The name of the well he used to water his flocks was named <i>esek</i> or "Contention."  Isaac moved on and dug another well which he named <i>sitnah</i> or "Hatred."  However, Isaac persisted and down the road built another well. This one did not attract adversity and was named <i>Reheboth</i> or "Room."  With persistence and a meek spirit, accepting the adversity, he finally found his room</p>
          <p>Over the years, says Jon Courson, I've watched lots of talented men and women who had an annointing, a calling and a gifting miss great opportunities because they dug a well and there was strife.  When they dug a second one, there was contention.  Yet instead of digging a third well, they gave up, thinking, "What's the use?  I won't be used.  Why go on?"  God's plan is that we keep digging, keep digging, keep digging until we find our Rehoboth, where there's room.</p>
          <p>Every one of you, without exception, has a Rehoboth awaiting you.  But the Enemy will try to discourage you through contention and strife.  Why does God allow this to happen?  Because He has a twofold task: not only to prepare a place for you, but to prepare you for the place.  This means you'll go through some trying times, some stretching points, and some questions, but you must not throw in the towel, or the trowel.  You keep digging, move down the road, dig again, move down the road, dig again, and eventually you will find your Rehoboth.</p>
          <p><i>This is a paraphrase from a devotional by Jon Courson "A Pillar by Day"</i></p>
          <p>Pray:  <i>"Dear Lord, help me to stay persistent and on task, for our Rehoboth will surely come."</i></p>
